> I'm Front-end developer ðŸŽ¨ & Star Wars lover, I love build interfaces and interactive products, I'm looking for a full time position as a front-end developer.

My interest in web development started back in 2017 when I decided to try understand the console web tools, fast-forward to today my main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences.
